/**
  This is an abstract class for a special type of UI model that can be
  associated with different image layers in SNAP. Examples of these models
  are models for contrast adjustment, colormap adjustment, etc., i.e.,
  models that link the GUI with one image layer. Two options were available:
  to associate a single such model with each image layer, or to create just
  one model, and allow the layer for that model to be switched. I chose
  the second option because it reduced the number of models that have to be
  kept around. However, the model has to keep track of layer-specific
  properties, and also has to be smart about registering and unregistering
  for events originating from the layers.

  This class is templated over a properties object, which contains some
  layer-specific properties that the model needs to store. For example, it
  can be the number of histogram bins to display for the contrast dialog.

  The second parameter is the type of the image wrapper that can participate
  in the association. It can be WrapperBase or one of its subclasses.
